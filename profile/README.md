# DisinfoLab

DisinfoLab is the country's first undergraduate-led mis/disinformation think tank and software incubator. Based at William & Mary's Global Research Institute, we are committed to making disinformation scholarship accessible to everyone.

Our mission is to produce novel, public facing research and software solutions to address current developments in politics, technology, and the intersection of the two. Using a multi-disciplinary approach, our team of undergraduates combines their collective strengths in data science and political science to map, track and inform about disinformation.
